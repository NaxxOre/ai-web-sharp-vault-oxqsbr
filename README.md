# Quick Dock

A small web project focused on one job: do it well.

## What this is
A small web project that stays simple on purpose. It’s meant to be easy to read, easy to run, and easy to extend.

## How to run
- Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Project layout
- `index.html` UI
- `app.js` behavior
- `style.css` styling

## Notes
Keep the core small; add features only when you need them.
